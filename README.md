# billservice
a simple medical bill upload service

### Goal
Your assignment is to implement a simple medical bill upload service using Node and Express.

### Assessment Tasks

Implement assignment using:
- Language: Node
- Framework: Express
- Two endpoints are required

    GET /items: returns a list of medical bills
    POST /items: creates a new medical bill

A medical bill has the following properties:

 - patient name and address

 - the hospital name

 - date of service

 - bill amount.

Both endpoints should accept and return JSON.

You do not need to persist the bills to a database. Keep them in memory.

Provide API tests for both endpoints.

Provide instructions on how to run your assignment in a README.

### Success Criteria

- Node best practices
- API implemented featuring the endpoints above
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### Submission

Please submit the application source code (upload to a public GitHub repo and share the link), along with a demo of the application running. You can use Postman to send requests to the server and screen record (upload or link to video).
